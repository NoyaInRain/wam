wam! ToDos
==========

## Issues

* Implement restore

* Reenable HTTPS (with nginx)

* Reenable password protection (with nginx)

* meetling.json uses incorrect port and Redis database

  Instead call `python3 -m meetling --port={port} --redis-url={databases.redis.name}`

* Build auto-update feature into wam!

  Should do rollback on failure. Update could be triggered via cron job.

* Make nginx server files defined via `static`

  See sample `wam.conf`

* Bower does not honor `.bowerrc`
